# The code was being a little finicky so I left the databases with the file here.

# The project does not have migrations enabled so you will not need to use Update-Database

# In order to explore the CRUD operations, you will need to log in as an administrator:

Username:  admin@gmail.com
Password:  Admin1!

# currently working on allowing a user to upload a picture from their computer which will be stored on the database
  and be displayed with the rest of the image.
  -The problem is that you can upload the image but then it does not actually save it to the database,
   it keeps reporting that they cell for the image is null.  
   
   
   --Rubric--
   Models -->           -5 total models. 3 working models, 2 models are exploratory right now for image upload
   Views -->            -Everything should be fully functional except maybe the image upload which Is currently in progress for the final iteration
                         The views also contain some role based security which will be evident if you click on details and then attempt the "edit"
                         button as a normal viewer and not an admin or superadmin.  
   Controllers -->      -All controllers should be fully functional with Role based security
   Navigation -->       -Should have smooth navigation with all working links.  There are also linkes to off the page which should be fully 
                         functional.
   Deliverables -->     -The project has a link on canvas to this git hub which can be viewed in github or downloaded as a zip and ran from there.
   Code Formatting -->  -Code formatting is readable and fairly documented but can also use more documentation in some spots.
   UI  -->              -The UI should be fully functional and also uses the "Amelia" bootrap theme from github.
   Addtn'lfeatures -->  -The project uses amelia bootrap, will run a chat client in the future and hopefully have a working image upload
                          by an adminitrator which is currently in progress.  The project also uses username and role based security for full CRUD operations.
                                
   Misc. -->            -The photo upload is presenting a lot of miscellaneous work.  Hopefully it will work.  
   Presentation -->     -Coming soon to a theater near you!
